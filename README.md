# WDSEventDB
WDSEventDB (Water Distribution System Event Diagnosis Benchmark) is an open-source, real-time, event detection dataset for water distribution networks. The realistic dataset is  collected from a sensor-instrumented water distribution testbed at the CONCISE research Lab, Lehigh University. The dataset features cyberattacks, leakages, and sensor-failure scenarios for the development and evaluation of event detection and localization frameworks.

The main folder WDSEventDB.zip contains four subfolders: (1) clean (normal operating conditions), (2) cyberattack (clean and attack events), (3) Leakage (clean and leak events), and (4) Sensor failure (clean and failure events).
